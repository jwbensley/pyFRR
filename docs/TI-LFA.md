### Limitations

FlexAgo for Prefix-SIDs is not supported. If a path from the repair node to the destination node is modified by a local policy on a node (e.g., a constrained path which isn't the default shortest path is applied to the destination node's "Node-SID" [a Prefix-SID]), that path is ignored, only the default shortest path is evaluated by this module.
